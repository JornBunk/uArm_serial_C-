# uArm_serial_C-
A few files to make it easier to send commands to the uArm swift (pro) over serial.

## notes:
- The code is written for uArm firmware V4.2.0.
- The code requires C++11 or higher.
- The example is a CodeLite project (https://codelite.org/).
When codelite is installed you can open the CodeLite-workspace to get the working example.
- The code does **not** work on Linux.
Making the code work on Linux is the next step for this project. Code contributions are welcomed.

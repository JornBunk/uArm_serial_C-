# uArm_serial_C-
A few files to make it easier to send commands to the uArm swift (pro) over serial.

## notes:
The code requires C++11 or higher.
The example is a CodeLite project (https://codelite.org/)
  - When codelite is installed you can open the CodeLite-workspace to get the working example.
The code does **not** work on Linux.
  - making the code work is the next step for this project. Code contributions are welcomed.
